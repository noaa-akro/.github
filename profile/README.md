## Do not check-in Confidential / Sensitive Data 

**This is a FISMA Low Zone, No PII/BII**

A low impact level occurs when the loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability could be expected to have a limited adverse effect on organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals.

A limited adverse effect means that, for example, the loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability might: 

-   Cause an interruption to mission capability, but the agency is still able to perform its primary functions 

-   Effectiveness of functions is noticeably reduced

-   Result in minor damage to organizational assets

-   Result in minor financial loss

-   Result in minor harm to individuals
